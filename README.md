A Matrix Multiplication Algorithm in Java using Eclipse. 

Task: To appreciate the value of counting loops (typically, for loop), write a program that implements matrix multiplication using counting loop constructs. Then write the same program using only logical loopsâ€”for example, while loops. 

Here I do two methods of doing matrix multiplication: A for loop versus a while loop.

The MatrixMultiplication.java is the file using the for loop method whereas the WhileMultiplication.java is the while loop version.
